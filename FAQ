This is the FAQ for the Haskell `AMI-Tool' package.

Q) Why am I getting this error, when building?:
/usr/bin/ld: /usr/lib/ghc-7.4.2/libHSrts.a(RtsAPI.o): relocation R_X86_64_32S against `ghczmprim_GHCziTypes_Czh_con_info' can not be used when making a shared object; recompile with -fPIC

A) I don't know, but was able to fix it by creating a symbolic link:
/usr/lib/ghc-7.4.2/libHSrts.so -> libHSrts-ghc7.4.2.so*

For more details, see this Google Groups thread:

Q) Okay, I've made it successfully through my first build, but your proposed quick test is failing:

dbanas@dbanas-lap:~/prj/AMI-Tool$ ./ami_test test.ami
libami.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

What do I do?

A) You need to prefix your command with a custom environment variable definition:

dbanas@dbanas-lap:~/prj/AMI-Tool$ LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:./" ./ami_test test.ami
Received this message from AMI_Init: AMI parameters parsed successfully.
Parameters from AMI_Init:

The linker doesn't search the local directory for shared objects, by default, as a security precaution.
(You can change this, permanently, but it's not advised.)
